# My First Style

### Description
* In this assignment, you will be provided with 5 files:
  * `MainApplicationTestRunner.js`, `MainApplicationTest.js`, `TestingUtilities.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css`.
* The goal is to make the `index.html` file look visually appealing by applying the appropriate styles.

#### Completing the Assignment
* Open the `style.css` file in an **editor**; _you will be modifying this file_.
  * This file contains the CSS structure for the page that you will be styling.
* Open the `MainApplicationTest.js` file in an **editor**; _you will **NOT** be modifying this file_.
  * This file contains the tests to verify that the styles have been applied correctly.
* Open the `index.html` file in a **browser**; _open the browser's developer console_.
  * To run the tests, refresh the page and view the test results in the developer console tab.
* Add the appropriate CSS styles to the `style.css` and the respective HTML attributes to the `index.html` file in order to pass the tests in the `MainApplicationTest.js` file.

#### Tips
* Pay attention to the selectors and values in the `MainApplicationTest.js` file.
* This is what the tests are expecting, and your styling will need to match these values in order to pass the tests.
* You may find it helpful to use the `console.log` function to print out the values of the elements that you are styling.
  * This can help you debug any issues that you are having.
* Remember to refresh the page in your web browser after making changes to the `index.html` file in order to see the updated styles.
